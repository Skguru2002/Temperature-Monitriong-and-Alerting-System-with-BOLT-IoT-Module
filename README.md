# Temperature-Monitriong-and-Alerting-System-with-BOLT-IoT-Module
The advantage of this automated detection and alerting system over the manual method is that it offers quick response time and accurate detection of an emergency and in turn leading faster diffusion of the critical situation.It is IoT Bolt Wi-Fi module based project with is more useful where temperature should be maintained properly and warn immediately if any problems occured ,especially in pharmaceutical companies.They will receive mail and SMS alert if something went wrong and able to predict future temperatures too.This Project is based on the BOLT IOT device used to monitor the temperature in the frezzer in the refrigerator. The Project Requirements : 1. Bolt IOT Wifi Module 2. Bread Board 3. connecting jumper Wires 4. Temperature Sensor LM35 5. Telegram Software 6. LED 7. Power Supply 8. Internet Connectivity.
